Basic Structure of the Game
    Players: You typically play against one or more opponents. Each player starts with 20 life points.
    Deck: Each player has a deck of at least 60 cards (mostly made up of creatures, spells, and lands).
Game Setup
    Starting Hand: Each player shuffles their deck and draws 7 cards.
    Starting: Players flip a coin or roll a die to determine who goes first.
Game Phases
    Untap Phase: You untap all your tapped cards.
    Upkeep Phase: You resolve any effects that happen during your upkeep (if applicable).
    Draw Phase: You draw one card from your deck.
    Main Phase 1: You can play a land and cast spells (creatures, enchantments, instants, sorceries).
    Combat Phase:
        Declare Attackers: Choose which creatures will attack.
        Each creature has an attack power, which determines how much damage it deals to an opponent or a blocking creature.
        Declare Blockers: Your opponent decides which of their creatures will block your attacking creatures.
        Each blocking creature has a health value, which indicates how much damage it can take before being destroyed.
        Combat Damage: Damage is assigned and dealt; if a creature's damage dealt equals or exceeds its health, it’s destroyed.
    Main Phase 2: You can play another land and cast more spells, similar to Main Phase 1.
    End Phase: Resolve any "end of turn" effects and discard down to your hand limit of 7 cards if necessary.
Types of Cards
    Lands: Produce mana, the resource used to cast spells.
    Creatures: Attack opponents and block their creatures. Each creature has:
        Attack Power: The amount of damage it deals.
    Health (Toughness): The amount of damage it can take before being destroyed.
    Instants: Can be played at almost any time (even during your opponent's turn).
    Sorceries: Can only be played during your own main phase.
    Enchantments: Provide ongoing effects.
    Artifacts: Similar to enchantments but can have different effects, often representing magical items.
Winning the Game
    You win by reducing your opponent's life total to 0, making them draw from an empty deck, or fulfilling specific win conditions from cards.
Key Concepts
    Mana: The currency used to cast spells, generated primarily from lands.
    Tapped vs. Untapped: Tapped cards cannot be used until they are untapped in the next untap phase.
    Summoning Sickness: Creatures cannot attack or use abilities the turn they come into play unless they have haste.
    Important Tips
        Card Abilities: Pay attention to special abilities on cards; they can greatly influence gameplay.
        Deck Building: A good mix of creature, spell, and land cards is crucial for a balanced deck.
        Adapt Strategy: Gameplay changes based on your draw and opponent’s actions, so be flexible.

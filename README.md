# MTG-Text-Based
This is the basic fundimantals of MTG. from having the differnt manas(swamp, island, forset, moutian, and plains decks) to having a "functional" ai that the player can battle with.

The decks will only be one type lands, maybe later down the line I will implemt duel type decks
  all decks will based off their real life conter part

the langauge that will be used on here is Java, I will try to implament a way to clear the screen so it makes the game look nicer

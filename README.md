# MTG-Text-Based
This is the basic fundimantals of MTG. from having the differnt manas(swamp, island, forset, moutian, and plains decks) to having a "functional" ai that the player can battle with.

The decks will only be one type lands, maybe later down the line I will implemt duel type decks
  all decks will based off their real life conter part

the langauge that will be used on here is Java, I will try to implament a way to clear the screen so it makes the game look nicer

1. check if everything works, push and pull works
2. make the simple deck, no function. just the decks
3. add the effcts of the cards
4. add a bot
5. make the bot choose a deck
6. build the layout
    1. drawing 7 cards
    2. placing down cards
    3. reading what type of card it is
        1. instant
        2. creature
        3. sorcury
        4. enchantment
    4. reading and appling the effect if there is one
    5. battle
    6. life point counter
    7. health counter on creature
    8. land counter
7. implament #6 for the bot
8. checking who won
9.
